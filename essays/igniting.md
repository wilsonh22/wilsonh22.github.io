For coding standards seem like a default for me since I have been using it since last year in my ICS 212 class. In this class we were grading a “Coding Style” which was grading though the same system using lint. Using lints does feel like a hassle in the beginning but, as I improve with my coding abilities I have found that lint is the greatest asset I have used in coding since ChatGPT.
	The organization of the code via lint makes everything easier to read and understand. When I code i tend to me spontaneous when trying to figure out how to approach a problem, so I will try one part as much as I can and if I can do it I’ll try to do a different class in the same code and do as much as I can in each part till I figure out a way to implement my code. With the use of lint I can keep my code in check so that it is readable allowing me to look back at the code if I need to relearn some concepts used in specific projects.
	Readability  is probably the most important thing any coding project should have. With lint, lint will correct any and every mistake that doesn’t meet the standard of lint. This is a great skill to have especially when you are collaborating with other people whether it's a job, project, or a hackathon. Readability is a must in order for other people to understand what your code does, being readable means they can see what you are trying to do and apply what you have to and connect to another part of the code. Like communication, everyone must understand and talk to each other if they want to work together.
	My experience with coding standards has been amazing as it helps me to be a better coder, while also giving me the ability to code with other people and have no issues on my end. Giving me the ability to be organized and have readable code makes my code easier to understand and use. Lint is definitely an extension I would highly recommend for programmers ro use and live by if they want to improve their code (not technically but aesthetically).
