The best way to learn about anything in life is to ask questions. Asking a question shows that you are curious about the problem presented to you and want to figure out how to fix it or why the problem happened in the first place. With that being said not all questions are good questions, meaning not all questions deserve an answer. When we ask questions we want to make sure these questions aren’t questions that aren’t easily answered through a quick Google search. So let's talk about what differentiates good questions from bad questions and how they affect how people react or answer them. 

Good questions are questions that are presentable meaning they are easy to understand. Questions need to be easy to understand because if the person trying to help doesn’t know what it is you’re confused with then they can’t help you. Here is a good example of a “Good Question” that I found on StackOverflow; the person wants to know how to make his iPhone animation sticky/static so the phone will fully unlock before moving out of the way. In said question, the person was short and to the point with his problem while also providing his source code for people to look at and dissect to be able to find a solution. Since this person provided all the sufficient information required to understand the problem shows they know how to ask appropriate questions while also being respectful to the helpers.

Bad questions are questions that most people will ignore because the person asking seems like a prick who did not put in the effort to make their question legible. A “Bad Question” I found on StackOverflow asked “Get total as you type with added column (append) using jQuery” followed by HTML code and Javascript code. This question makes it hard to answer because they don’t describe the problem, tell what happened, or what they are trying, and throw a bunch of code with little to no description of what the code is supposed to do. To most people trying to help this person seems like a person who, “takes but never gives”; they are the type of person who only wants the answers and does not learn or understand why the problem surfaced in the first place. If they want to understand or be worth teaching they they would talk about their approach and specifically ask what they need rather than saying they have a problem they need fixed.

Writing a “Good Question” will make the difference if you want your question to be answered. Imagine being the hacker who reads the question, “What kind of questions would you be willing to answer”? If the questions make you do a bunch of extra words that couldn’t have been avoided if they gave the specific information and organization the good questions would have. If you would not want to answer the question because it takes too much effort to even comprehend what they need to figure out or what the problem is, then how can you expect other people to answer the question? So MAKE SURE YOU ASK GOOD QUESTIONS IF YOU’RE GOING TO ASK OTHER PEOPLE TO HELP YOU.
