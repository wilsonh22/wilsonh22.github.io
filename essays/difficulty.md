	Ever since I was young I always had an interest in technology. Before I knew about computer science I wanted to be an engineer because I wanted to build things. I remember the first thing I ever built was a little robot made of snack parts consisting of Capri Sun boxes, clear plastic bowls, ripped cloth, and markers. I made this as an arts and crafts assignment in the third grade and the best part about it was that I got to take it home. I showed it to my parents and said “Look, look I am this in class. It's my new little brother”.  If it weren’t for that day I don’t think I could have ever gotten into computer science today. The fact that I was able to use my creativity to make something with the resources available to me pushed me into the tech-driven mindset that I have today.

	In the field of computer science, I want to be able to work with data. My end goal is to become a data scientist who can predict the future based on the knowledge/data available to said subject. I have researched the field and I have found that the main qualities of this field almost perfectly match with all my interests. Data science is a good middle ground for computer science, math, and business expertise, all of which were the three majors I had a lot of interest in except math. My interest in math was mainly just to understand why things work; I like to know and learn things but trying to do the math and doing it right drives me NUTS!!

	Most expertise that I want to learn will be things coming from this class. Learning to use APIs and building full-stack applications is what I want to get out of this class to start building projects that interest me. My current ability has plateaued. I have tried to do independent projects and project-based learning, figuring out everything on my own or online, but every time I have tried I always experience massive frustration and burn-out to the point where I can’t even call what I made a project. With this class, I have a professor and TAs who I have to help me when I get stuck, but also I have a wonderful guide website that sets students up for success as long as they put the expected amount of effort into the class.

	The possibilities with software engineering are endless, especially now since AI is easily accessible. You implement them into whatever project you want and make it do whatever you want. I want to explore these possibilities with software engineering so I can make projects that I have an interest in. When trying to create a project all I could do was make small projects that only project into the terminal. The only knowledge of coding I had at the time was either Java or C and we only use those languages exclusively, but with ICS 314 we are learning how to develop front-end programs to have web pages like YouTube, Google,  and Instagram where you can design the page and make you own instead of print statements in the terminal. To be able to create something that's even worth looking at aesthetically gives me excitement and motivation to create something that I can call my own and hopefully be of use to other people.
